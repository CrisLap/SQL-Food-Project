## General info
I will analyse data on food waste.
The exercise is very free and allows me to take a look at all the operators and functions of SQL. 
The project involves developing several select and, before each block of the script, inserting a comment explaining what is the expected result of that procedure. This is done by using the comment function in the SQL script.
Food waste is a serious problem in most developed countries. According to the data, â…“ of the world's food is thrown away and wasted annually, while a large proportion of the world's population is still starving.
Thanks to the Food and Agriculture Organisation dataset available at https://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste/flw-data/en/ I try to understand which states waste the most, which are the most virtuous and which types of food are most wasted.
